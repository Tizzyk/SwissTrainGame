# SwissTrainGame
Creating the dice game we played on a train through Switzerland.

How the game works
The game has many names: Shut the Box, Blitz, Bakarat, Canoga, Klackers, Batten Down the Hatches, Kingoball, Trictrac, Cut Throat, Fork Your Neighbor, and Jackpot. I call it...the Swiss Train Game.

Basically, the game is played with two die and twelve tiles. The twelve tile start face-up, indicating they are playable. The player rolls the two die and will get a maximum of three choices as to what tiles can be played, one for each die result, and one for the sum of the die. For example, if the die results are 2 and 4, the player could play tiles 2, 4 or 6. The player chooses one and flips the tile face-down, now making it unplayable. The player continues until no more moves can be played. When no more moves are possible, the score is calculated by adding up the values of all of the remaining face-up tiles. If the player is able to turn all tiles face-down, he scores -20. The game is played to a final score. Once a player hits the score, they are eliminated. Last player remaining wins.
